        My hobbies are <strong>windsurfing</strong> and
        <strong> video games</strong>

        I started windsurfing as I was 13 years old and I still love doing it. I
        even managed to finish the instructor course and recived an instructor
        certificate. During summer I usually travel somewhere where there is
        strong wind and a good weather condition for windsurfing.

        For computer games I started playing as child usually with my older
        brother. My beloved games are "Divinity: Orginal Sin 2", "The Witcher 3:
        Wild Hunt" and "Halo 3". When new big game is released I almost always
        play through it.
