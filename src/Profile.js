        <p>
          I am a fourth-year student of Wroc≈Çaw University of Science and
          Technology, specialization Applied Computer Science. I'm beginning my
          web development journey and I aim to become a senior front-end
          developer. I love creating websites and solving new problems. I learn
          fast and I am always open to constructive criticism.

        I also have many different skills. I have a driving license B category
        that is not so amazing but I also have a license of a motorboat helmsman
        and I finished a windsurfing instructor course and recieved the
        instructor certificate. Also since I was 7 years old I play the piano
        and I think I'm not so bad at it (see here (IN PROGRESS)) During winter
        I like to ski and snowboard. I started skiing when I was little and
        later as I became older i tried snowboarding and also learned it quiet
        well. During summer I prefer the seaside. I usually do some water sports
        or some activities connected with water.
